            <p>This was a project I did just for fun!</p>
            <p>While learning Aframe and watching SpaceX launches I had the thought that this would be the perfect platform for a 3D model of our solar system that you could explore. So I ran with the idea and created it. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out after upgrading Aframe to version 0.9.0. Check it out below and let me know what you think!</p>
