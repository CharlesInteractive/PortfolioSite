            <p>Hi, I'm Charles Carroll. Welcome to my github page.</p>
            <p>I graduated in December 2016 from the University of Toledo College of Business Innovation with a Bachelors of Business Administration. I majored in Information Systems and minored in International Business. For my minor I studied abroad for two semesters in Torino, Italy at SAA School of Management Torino from September 2014 to June 2015.</p>
            <h3 class="text-center">Professional Work</h3>
            <p>After collage I began working at a web consultant firm developing websites, content management systems, apps, and virtual tours. There my skills as a developer grew well beyond what I knew I was capable of. I also got to be apart of many great projects around Toledo and the US.</p>
            <p>I wanted to use this site to display a few of the AR projects I have built using A-Frame Web VR.</p>
            <p>Feel free to fork/comment/contibute to the them as I would love to make them better.</p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
